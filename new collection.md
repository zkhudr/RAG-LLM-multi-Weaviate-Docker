Okay, to add a separate knowledge base for "art" alongside the existing "industrial_tech" collection in your Weaviate RAG system, you'll need to modify several components to handle multiple collections. Here's a step-by-step guide based on the provided system structure:

Create the "Art" Collection in Weaviate:

You need to define and create a new collection schema within your Weaviate instance. Following Weaviate conventions, collection names should start with an uppercase letter, so Art would be appropriate.

Decide on the properties for the Art collection (e.g., title, artist, description, year).

Use the Weaviate client library (v4 is used in keywords_builder_v3.py) within a setup script or modify the ingestion scripts to create the collection if it doesn't exist. This involves using client.collections.create() with the name "Art" and specifying its properties, vectorizer configuration, and generative module configuration (likely mirroring the settings used for industrial_tech unless you want different models for art).

Example Snippet (Conceptual Python v4):

python
import weaviate
import weaviate.classes as wvc

client = weaviate.connect_to_local(...) # Connect as usual

collection_name = "Art"
if not client.collections.exists(collection_name):
    client.collections.create(
        name=collection_name,
        properties=[
            wvc.config.Property(name="title", data_type=wvc.config.DataType.TEXT),
            wvc.config.Property(name="artist", data_type=wvc.config.DataType.TEXT),
            wvc.config.Property(name="description", data_type=wvc.config.DataType.TEXT)
            # Add other properties as needed
        ],
        # Ensure vectorizer/generative configs match your needs/existing setup
        vectorizer_config=wvc.config.Configure.Vectorizer.text2vec_openai(), # Or your chosen vectorizer
        generative_config=wvc.config.Configure.Generative.openai() # Or your chosen generative module
    )
    print(f"Collection '{collection_name}' created.")
else:
    print(f"Collection '{collection_name}' already exists.")

client.close()
Prepare and Segregate "Art" Data:

Organize your source documents related to art into a separate directory (e.g., ./data_art) distinct from the industrial tech documents (e.g., ./data).

Adapt the Ingestion Process:

Modify your ingestion script (e.g., ingest_docs_v3.py referenced in) to accept the target collection name as a parameter.

Update the ingest_process_documents function to use the provided collection name when interacting with Weaviate (connecting to the collection, adding objects).

Modify the CLI tool (ingestion_optimization_v3.py):

In prompt_parameters, add an input prompt to specify the collection_name, defaulting perhaps to industrial_tech.

In option_ingestion (Mode 1), pass the chosen collection_name and the appropriate data directory (e.g., ./data_art) to the ingest_process_documents function.

Modify the RAG Pipeline and Retrieval:

Configuration: Add a setting to your main configuration (config_settings.yaml and corresponding Pydantic model in config.py) to specify the currently active Weaviate collection. Let's call it WEAVIATE_COLLECTION_NAME.

Retriever (retriever.py): Update the retriever logic (likely where client.collections.get(...) is called) to use the collection name specified in the configuration (cfg.weaviate.collection_name or similar) instead of a hardcoded default.

API (app.py):

Add an API endpoint (e.g., /select_collection/<collection_name>) that allows changing the active collection. This endpoint would update the cfg.weaviate.collection_name in the running application's configuration (and optionally save it back to config_settings.yaml).

Crucially, after changing the collection name in the config, you might need to re-initialize the IndustrialAutomationPipeline or at least the TechnicalRetriever instance within the Flask app so it connects to the newly selected collection.

The existing /run_pipeline endpoint would then implicitly use the currently configured collection via the cfg object passed to the pipeline/retriever.

Adapt Keyword Extraction (if used for "Art"):

The keywords_builder_v3.py script already supports specifying the collection via the --collection command-line argument.

Update the CLI tool (ingestion_optimization_v3.py):

Modify prompt_parameters for Mode 5 to ask for the target collection_name.

Update option_domain_keywords to pass the chosen collection name when calling the keyword building logic (which internally would use the --collection argument or equivalent).

Update the CLI Tool (ingestion_optimization_v3.py):

As mentioned in steps 3 and 5, update prompt_parameters to ask for the target collection_name for modes that interact with Weaviate collections (Ingestion, Keyword Extraction, potentially Generation Test).

Ensure the chosen collection name is passed correctly to the underlying functions for each mode. For Mode 6 (Generation Test), ensure the IndustrialAutomationPipeline instantiated uses the configuration reflecting the selected collection for testing.

Update Frontend (Optional but Recommended):

If you want users to switch between knowledge bases via the web UI, add a dropdown or buttons to the Alpine.js frontend.

When the user selects a collection (e.g., "Art" or "Industrial Tech"), the frontend should call the new /select_collection/<collection_name> API endpoint you created in step 4. This tells the backend which collection subsequent queries should target.

By implementing these changes, your system will be able to manage and query multiple distinct collections within Weaviate, allowing you to have separate knowledge bases like "industrial_tech" and "Art".
